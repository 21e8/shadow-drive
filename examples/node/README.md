- Create a paper wallet using solana-keygen with -o specifying the outfile name
- replace the import path below with the path to your new wallet
  ```js
  import driveUser from "some_shdw_funded_wallet";
  ```
- fund that wallet with $SHDW and a small amount of $SOL in order to use shadow-drive commands
